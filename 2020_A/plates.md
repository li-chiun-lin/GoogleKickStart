# Problem

Dr. Patel has $N$ stacks of plates. Each stack contains $K$ plates. Each plate has a positive beauty value, describing how beautiful it looks.

Dr. Patel would like to take exactly $P$ plates to use for dinner tonight. If he would like to take a plate in a stack, he must also take all of the plates above it in that stack as well.

Help Dr. Patel pick the $P$ plates that would maximize the total sum of beauty values.
