# Problem

Dr. Patel has $N$ stacks of plates. Each stack contains $K$ plates. Each plate has a positive beauty value, describing how beautiful it looks.

Dr. Patel would like to take exactly $P$ plates to use for dinner tonight. If he would like to take a plate in a stack, he must also take all of the plates above it in that stack as well.

Help Dr. Patel pick the $P$ plates that would maximize the total sum of beauty values.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.  
Each test case begins with a line containing the three integers $N$, $K$ and $P$.  
Then, $N$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains $K$ integers, describing the beauty values of each stack of plates from top to bottom.
