# Problem

Everybody loves street food, especially the local residents of Bitetown! For this reason, you have decided to build exactly K food stalls and one warehouse on the main street of Bitetown.

The main street is a long horizontal line that is 109 metres long. There are N spots that you are allowed to build stalls or a warehouse on. You may not build anywhere else on the street. The i-th spot is Xi meters from the left end of the street.

You can build at most one stall or warehouse at the i-th spot (but not both), which costs Ci dollars. Additionally, if the warehouse is in the j-th spot, then building a stall in the i-th spot costs an extra |Xj - Xi| dollars.

Please find the minimum cost to build exactly K food stalls and one warehouse.
