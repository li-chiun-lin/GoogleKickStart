# Problem

Professor Shekhu has another problem for Akki today. He has given him three positive integers $A$, $N$ and $P$ and wants him to calculate the remainder when $A^{N!}$ is divided by $P$. As usual, $N!$ denotes the product of the first $N$ positive integers.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ lines follow.  
Each line contains three integers $A$, $N$ and $P$, as described above.
