# Problem

Wheatley is at the best party in the world: it has infinitely many cakes! Each cake is a square with an integer side length (in cm). The party has infinitely many cakes of every possible integer side length. The cakes all have the same depth, so we will only consider their areas.

Wheatley is determined to eat one or more cakes that have a total combined area of exactly $N cm^2$. But, since he is health-conscious, he wants to eat as few cakes as possible. Can you help him calculate the minimum number of cakes he can eat?
