# Problem

Cristobal has an array of N (possibly negative) integers. The i-th integer in his array is Ai. A contiguous non-empty subarray of Cristobal's array is perfect if its total sum is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that is the product of a non-negative integer with itself. For example, the first five perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 9 and 16.

How many subarrays are perfect? Two subarrays are different if they start or end at different indices in the array, even if the subarrays contain the same values in the same order.
