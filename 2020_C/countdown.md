# Problem

Avery has an array of $N$ positive integers. The $i$-th integer of the array is $A_i$.

A contiguous subarray is an $m$-countdown if it is of length $m$ and contains the integers $m, m-1, m-2, ..., 2, 1$ in that order. For example, [3, 2, 1] is a 3-countdown.

Can you help Avery count the number of $K$-countdowns in her array?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.  
Each test case begins with a line containing the integers $N$ and $K$.  
The second line contains $N$ integers. The $i$-th integer is $A_i$.
