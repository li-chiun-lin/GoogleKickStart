# Problem

Avery has an array of N positive integers. The i-th integer of the array is Ai.

A contiguous subarray is an m-countdown if it is of length m and contains the integers m, m-1, m-2, ..., 2, 1 in that order. For example, [3, 2, 1] is a 3-countdown.

Can you help Avery count the number of K-countdowns in her array?
