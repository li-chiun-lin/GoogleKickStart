# Problem

No Nine is a counting game that you can try when you are bored. In this game, you are only allowed to say numbers that are legal. A number is legal if and only if all of the following are true:

- it is a natural number (i.e. in the set {1, 2, 3...})
- it does not contain the digit 9 anywhere in its base 10 representation
- it is not divisible by 9

For example, the numbers 16 and 17 are legal. The numbers 18, 19, 17.2, and -17 are not legal.

On the first turn of the game, you choose and say a legal number F. On each subsequent turn, you say the next legal number. For example, if you played a game with F = 16, you would say 16, 17, 20, 21, and so on.

Alice is very good at this game and never makes mistakes. She remembers that she played a game in which the first number was F and the last number was L (when she got tired of the game and stopped), and she wonders how many turns were in the game in total (that is, how many numbers she said).
