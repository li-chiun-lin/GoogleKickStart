# Problem

It is important for researchers to write many high quality academic papers. Jorge has recently discovered a way to measure how impactful a researcher's papers are: the H-index.

The H-index score of a researcher is the largest integer h such that the researcher has h papers with at least h citations each.

Jorge has written N papers in his lifetime. The i-th paper has Ai citations. The number of citations that each paper has will never change after it is written. Please help Jorge determine his H-index score after each paper he wrote.
