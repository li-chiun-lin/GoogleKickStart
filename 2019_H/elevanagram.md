# Problem

It is a well known fact that a number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is equal to $0$ modulo $11$. For example, $8174958$ is a multiple of $11$, since $8 - 1 + 7 - 4 + 9 - 5 + 8 = 22$.

Given a number that consists of digits from $1$-$9$, can you rearrange the digits to create a number that is divisible by $11$?

Since the number might be quite large, you are given integers $A_1, A_2, ..., A_9$. There are $A_i$ digits $i$ in the number, for all $i$.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ lines follow.  
Each line contains the nine integers $A_1, A_2, ..., A_9$.
