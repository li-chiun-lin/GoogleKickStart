# Problem

It is a well known fact that a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is equal to 0 modulo 11. For example, 8174958 is a multiple of 11, since 8 - 1 + 7 - 4 + 9 - 5 + 8 = 22.

Given a number that consists of digits from 1-9, can you rearrange the digits to create a number that is divisible by 11?

Since the number might be quite large, you are given integers A1, A2, ..., A9. There are Ai digits i in the number, for all i.
