# Problem

Enzo is doing renovation for his new house. The most difficult part is to buy exactly the right number of tiles. He wants $N$ tiles of different sizes. Of course they have to be cut from the tiles he bought. All the required tiles are square. The lengths of side of the tiles are $2^{S_1}, 2^{S_2}, ..., 2^{S_N}$. He can only buy a lot of tiles sized $M \times M$, and he decides to only cut tiles parallel to their sides for convenience. How many tiles does he need to buy?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases: $T$. $T$ lines follow. Each line start with the number $N$ and $M$, indicating the number of required tiles and the size of the big tiles Enzo can buy. $N$ numbers follow: $S_1, S_2, ... S_N$, showing the sizes of the required tiles.
