# Problem

You are given a palindrome string $P$ of length $N$ consisting of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Find the shortest non-empty palindrome string $Q$ such that $P$ concatenated with $Q$ forms a palindrome. Formally, the string $PQ$ forms a palindrome.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$ denoting the length of the string $P$.

The second line of each test case contains a palindrome string $P$ of length $N$.
