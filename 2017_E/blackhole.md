# Problem

Alice is trying to prevent dangerous black holes from threatening Earth. Right now, there are three black holes that are different points in 3-D space. Alice will create exactly three containment spheres, and all three must have the same radius. Spheres do not interfere with each other, so they may overlap.

Alice must place these spheres so that each black hole is covered by at least one sphere. Moreover, to ensure stability, the total set of points covered by at least one sphere must form a single connected area.

Alice wants to solve this critical problem as inexpensively as possible. What is the minimum radius that she can use?
