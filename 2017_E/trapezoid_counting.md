# Problem

In this problem, we will consider a trapezoid to be a convex quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides. If the lengths of the two non-parallel sides are equal, we say the trapezoid is isosceles.

You have some wooden sticks of various lengths, and you need to pick exactly four of them to form the four sides of an isosceles trapezoid. How many different sets of four sticks will allow this? Even if two sticks have the same length, they are considered to be different sticks. Sticks could not be bended and broke into parts.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow; each consists of two lines.  
The first line consists of one integer $N$, the number of sticks.  
The second line consists of $N$ integers; the $i$-th of these, $L_i$, represents the length of the $i$-th stick.
