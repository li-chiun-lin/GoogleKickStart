# Problem

You want to create a certain target string $S$, which consists only of lowercase English letters. You start with an empty string, and you are allowed to perform the following operations:

- Add any single lowercase letter to the end of your string.
- Copy any substring of your string (that is, all of the characters between some start point in your string and some end point in your string) to the clipboard. Doing this overwrites whatever was in the clipboard before. The clipboard starts off empty.
- Add the entire contents of the clipboard to the end of your string. (The contents of the clipboard do not change.)

What is the smallest number of operations needed to create your target string? Note that you must create exactly the target string, with no additional letters.
