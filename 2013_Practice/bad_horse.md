# Problem

As the leader of the Evil League of Evil, Bad Horse has a lot of problems to deal with. Most recently, there have been far too many arguments and far too much backstabbing in the League, so much so that Bad Horse has decided to split the league into two departments in order to separate troublesome members. Being the Thoroughbred of Sin, Bad Horse isn't about to spend his valuable time figuring out how to split the League members by himself. That what he's got you -- his loyal henchman -- for.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow. Each test case starts with a positive integer $M$ on a line by itself -- the number of troublesome pairs of League members. The next $M$ lines each contain a pair of names, separated by a single space.
