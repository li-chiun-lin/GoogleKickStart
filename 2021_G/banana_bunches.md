# Problem

Barbara goes to Alan's banana farm, where the N banana trees are organized in one long line represented by an array B. The tree at position i has Bi banana bunches. Each tree has the same cost. Once Barbara buys a tree, she gets all the banana bunches on that tree.

Alan has a special rule: because he does not want too many gaps in his line, he allows Barbara to buy at most 2 contiguous sections of his banana tree line.

Barbara wants to buy some number of trees such that the total number of banana bunches on these purchased trees equals the capacity K of her basket. She wants to do this while spending as little money as possible. How many trees should she buy?
