# Problem

You are given two integers, the number of vertices N and area A. You need to construct a simple polygon of N vertices such that the area of the polygon is exactly A2, and all the vertices have non-negative integer coordinates with value up to $10^9$.

A simple polygon is one that:
Defines a closed area.
Does not have self-intersections, even at a single point.
No two consecutive edges form a straight angle.
