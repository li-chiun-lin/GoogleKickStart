# Problem

An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the differences between consecutive integers are equal. For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3], and [9, 7, 5, 3] are arithmetic arrays, while [1, 3, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are not arithmetic arrays.

Sarasvati has an array of $N$ non-negative integers. The $i$-th integer of the array is $A_i$. She wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray from her array that has the maximum length. Please help her to determine the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic subarray.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.  
Each test case begins with a line containing the integer $N$.  
The second line contains $N$ integers. The $i$-th integer is $A_i$.
