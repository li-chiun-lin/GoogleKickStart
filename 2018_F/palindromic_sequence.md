# Problem

Hannah is working on a new language which consists only of first L lowercase letters of the English alphabet. She is obsessed with palindromes, which are words that read the same forward and backward, e.g. hannah and civic. She has written down all of the words in her language of length at most N, that are also palindromes.

Now, she is interested in finding the length of the word that is lexicographically Kth smallest among all the words she has written. A word composed of ordered letters a1, a2, ..., ap is lexicographically smaller than word b1, b2, ..., bq if ai < bi, where i is the first index where characters differ in the two words. Also, a prefix of a word is considered lexicographically smaller than the word itself. For example, the following words are arranged in lexicographically increasing order: a, aa, aba, cabac, d.
