# Problem

Ayla has two strings A and B, each of length L, and each of which is made of uppercase English alphabet letters. She would like to know how many different substrings of A appear as anagrammatic substrings of B. More formally, she wants the number of different ordered tuples (i, j), with 0 ≤ i ≤ j < L, such that the i-th through j-th characters of A (inclusive) are the same multiset of characters as at least one contiguous substring of length (j - i + 1) in B.
