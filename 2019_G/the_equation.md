# Problem

The laws of the universe can be represented by an array of N non-negative integers. The i-th of these integers is Ai.

The universe is good if there is a non-negative integer k such that the following equation is satisfied: (A1 xor k) + (A2 xor k) + ... (AN xor k) â‰¤ M, where xor denotes the bitwise exclusive or.

What is the largest value of k for which the universe is good?
