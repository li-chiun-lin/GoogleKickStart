# Problem

Aninda and Boon-Nam are security guards at a small art museum. Their job consists of N shifts. During each shift, at least one of the two guards must work.

The two guards have different preferences for each shift. For the i-th shift, Aninda will gain Ai happiness points if he works, while Boon-Nam will gain Bi happiness points if she works.

The two guards will be happy if both of them receive at least H happiness points. How many different assignments of shifts are there where the guards will be happy?

Two assignments are considered different if there is a shift where Aninda works in one assignment but not in the other, or there is a shift where Boon-Nam works in one assignment but not in the other.
