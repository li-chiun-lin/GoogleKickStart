# Problem

Supervin is a librarian handling an ancient book with N pages, numbered from 1 to N. Since the book is too old, unfortunately M pages are torn out: page number P1, P2, ..., PM.

Today, there are Q lazy readers who are interested in reading the ancient book. Since they are lazy, each reader will not necessarily read all the pages. Instead, the i-th reader will only read the pages that are numbered multiples of Ri and not torn out. Supervin would like to know the sum of the number of pages read by each reader.
