# Problem

A group of people are sitting in a circle, playing a special version of rock, paper, scissors. In this game, each person chooses rock, paper, or scissors in secret and then everyone reveals their choice to everyone else. Each person then compares their selection to their two neighbors, and can win, lose, or tie against each of them independently. The only way to tie is when both people make the same choice.

You want to make it so that no game is a tie. For each player, you can let them keep their choice, or you can ask them to change to any of the other two options (you choose to which one). What is the minimum number of people you need to request a change from to ensure that there are no ties between neighbors after those changes are made?
