# Problem

Anna has a row of N blocks, each with exactly one letter from A to Z written on it. The blocks are numbered 1, 2, ..., N from left to right.

Today, she is learning about palindromes. A palindrome is a string that is the same written forwards and backwards. For example, ANNA, RACECAR, AAA and X are all palindromes, while AB, FROG and YOYO are not.

Bob wants to test how well Anna understands palindromes, and will ask her Q questions. The i-th question is: can Anna use all of the blocks numbered from Li to Ri, inclusive, rearranging them if necessary, to form a palindrome? After each question, Anna puts the blocks back in their original positions.

Please help Anna by finding out how many of Bob's questions she can answer "yes" to.
