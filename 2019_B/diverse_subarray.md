# Problem

Vanity has N trinkets on her shelf, numbered 1, 2, ..., N from left to right. Trinkets come in different types, which are denoted by positive integers. The i-th trinket on her shelf is of type Ai.

She is going to see her family overseas today and would like to bring as many trinkets as she can. However, since she is in a hurry, Vanity must take a consecutive interval of trinkets. Formally, Vanity selects two indices, l and r, and takes all of the trinkets numbered l, l+1, ..., r-1, r. Also, due to tax rules, airport security will throw away all trinkets of a type if Vanity has more than S of that type in the chosen interval.

For example, suppose that S = 2, and Vanity brings six trinkets: one of type 0, two of type 1, and three of type 2. She will be allowed to keep the trinket of type 0 and both trinkets of type 1, but she will lose all of the trinkets of type 2!

Vanity needs to choose l and r such that she can take the maximum number of trinkets for her family. What is the maximum number of trinkets she can bring?
