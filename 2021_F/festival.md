You have just heard about a wonderful festival that will last for $D$ days, numbered from $1$ to $D$. There will be $N$ attractions at the festival. The $i$-th attraction has a happiness rating of $h_i$ and will be available from day $s_i$ until day $e_i$, inclusive.

You plan to choose one of the days to attend the festival. On that day, you will choose up to $K$ attractions to ride. Your total happiness will be the sum of happiness ratings of the attractions you chose to ride.

What is the maximum total happiness you could achieve?
