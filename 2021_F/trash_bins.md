# Problem

In the city where you live, Kickstartland, there is one particularly long street with N houses on it. This street has length N, and the N houses are evenly placed along it, that is, the first house is at position 1, the second house is at position 2, and so on. The distance between any pair of houses i and j is |iâˆ’j|, where |x| denotes the absolute value of x.

Some of these houses have trash bins in front of them. That means that the owners of such houses do not have to walk when they want to take their trash out. However, for the owners of houses that do not have trash bins in front of them, they have to walk towards some house that has a trash bin in front of it, either to the left or to the right of their own house.

To save time, every house owner always takes their trash out to the trash bin that is closest to their houses. If there are two trash bins that are both the closest to a house, then the house owner can walk to any of them.

Given the number of houses N, and the description of which of these houses have trash bins in front of them, find out what is the sum of the distances that each house owner has to walk to take their trashes out. You can assume that at least one house has a trash bin in front of it.
