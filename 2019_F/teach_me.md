# Problem

Here at Google we love teaching new skills to each other! There are N employees at Google, numbered from 1 to N. There are a total of S different skills, numbered from 1 to S. Each employee knows up to 5 different skills.

The i-th employee can mentor the j-th employee if there is a skill that the i-th employee knows that the j-th employee does not know. How many ordered pairs (i, j) are there where the i-th employee can mentor the j-th employee?
