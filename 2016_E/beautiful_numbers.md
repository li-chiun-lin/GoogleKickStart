# Problem

We consider a number to be beautiful if it consists only of the digit $1$ repeated one or more times. Not all numbers are beautiful, but we can make any base $10$ positive integer beautiful by writing it in another base.

Given an integer $N$, can you find a base $B$ (with $B > 1$) to write it in such that all of its digits become $1$? If there are multiple bases that satisfy this property, choose the one that maximizes the number of $1$ digits.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line with an integer $N$.
