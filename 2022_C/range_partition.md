# Problem

Alan and Barbara suddenly felt like playing with numbers. Alan chooses a non-empty subset from the set of first $N$ positive integers $(1,2,â€¦,N)$. Barbara takes the rest of the numbers (if any) from the set. And then they both calculate the sum of the elements in their respective sets.

Alan believes in a magic ratio, which is $X:Y$. Hence, Alan wants to choose the subset in such a way that the ratio between the sum of Alan's subset and the sum of Barbara's subset is exactly $X:Y$.

Can you help Alan to choose a subset that can achieve the desired ratio?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.  
Each test case has a single line containing three integers, $N$, $X$ and $Y$, as described above.
