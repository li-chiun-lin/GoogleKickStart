# Problem

You have been hired recently as the Chief Decision Maker (CDM) at a famous parcel delivery company, congratulations! Customers love speedy deliveries of their parcels and you have decided to decrease the time it takes to deliver parcels around the world to win customers. You have introduced this idea to the authorities and they have allocated you enough budget to build at most one new delivery office.

The world can be divided into an R Ã— C grid of squares. Each square either contains a delivery office or it does not. You may pick a grid square that does not already contain a delivery office and build a new delivery office there.

The delivery time of a parcel to a square is 0 if that square contains a delivery office. Otherwise, it is defined as the minimum Manhattan distance between that square and any other square containing a delivery office. The overall delivery time is the maximum of delivery times of all the squares. What is the minimum overall delivery time you can obtain by building at most one new delivery office?

Note: The Manhattan distance between two squares (r1,c1) and (r2,c2) is defined as |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|, where |*| operator denotes the absolute value.
