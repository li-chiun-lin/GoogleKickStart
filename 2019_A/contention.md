# Problem

You are selling tickets for the front row of seats at a movie theater. The front row has N seats, numbered 1 to N from left to right. You have been out of the office the last week, and upon your return, Q bookings for seats have piled up! The i-th booking requests all the seats from Li to Ri inclusive. You now have the boring job of entering each booking into the system, one at a time.

Since some of the bookings may overlap, the system might not be able to fulfill each booking entirely. When you enter a booking into the system, it will assign every seat requested by the booking that hasn't already been assigned to a booking entered into the system earlier.

What is the largest integer k where there exists an order that you can enter the bookings into the system, such that each booking is assigned at least k seats?
