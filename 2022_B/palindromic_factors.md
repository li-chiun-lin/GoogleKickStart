# Problem

You are given a positive integer $A$. Find the number of factors of $A$ which are palindromes. A number is called a palindrome if it remains the same when the digits in decimal representation are reversed.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ lines follow.  
Each line represents a test case and contains a single integer $A$.
