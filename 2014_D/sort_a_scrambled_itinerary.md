# Problem

Once upon a day, Mary bought a one-way ticket from somewhere to somewhere with some flight transfers.

Obviously, transfer flights at a city twice or more doesn't make any sense. So Mary will not do that.

Unfortunately, after she received the tickets, she messed up the tickets and she forgot the order of the ticket.

Help Mary rearrange the tickets to make the tickets in correct order.
