# Problem

Let us call an integer interesting if the product of its digits is divisible by the sum of its digits. You are given two integers $A$ and $B$. Find the number of interesting integers between $A$ and $B$ (both inclusive).

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ lines follow.  
Each line represents a test case and contains two integers: $A$ and $B$.
