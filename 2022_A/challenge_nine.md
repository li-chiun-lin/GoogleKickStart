# Problem

Ada gives John a positive integer $N$. She challenges him to construct a new number (without leading zeros), that is a multiple of $9$, by inserting exactly one digit $(0 â€¦ 9)$ anywhere in the given number $N$. It is guaranteed that $N$ does not have any leading zeros.

As John prefers smaller numbers, he wants to construct the smallest such number possible. Can you help John?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.  
Each test case has a single line containing a positive integer $N$, the number Ada gives John.
