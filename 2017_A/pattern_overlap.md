# Problem

Alice likes reading and buys a lot of books. She stores her books in two boxes; each box is labeled with a pattern that matches the titles of all of the books stored in that box. A pattern consists of only uppercase/lowercase English alphabet letters and stars (*). A star can match between zero and four letters. For example, books with the titles **GoneGirl** and **GoneTomorrow** can be put in a box with the pattern **Gone\*\***, but books with the titles **TheGoneGirl**, **Gonetomorrow**, and **GoneWithTheWind** cannot.

Alice is wondering whether there is any book that could be stored in either of the boxes. That is, she wonders if there is a title that matches both boxes' patterns.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow. Each consists of two lines; each line has one string in which each character is either an uppercase/lowercase English letter or *.
