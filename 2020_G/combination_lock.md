# Problem

A combination lock has W wheels, each of which has the integer values 1 through N on it, in ascending order.

At any moment, each wheel shows a specific value on it. Xi is the initial value shown on the i-th wheel.

You can use a single move to change a wheel from showing the value X to showing either X+1 or X-1, wrapping around between 1 and N. For example, if a wheel currently shows the value 1, in one move you can change its value to 2 or N.

Given all wheels' initial values, what is the minimum number of moves to get all wheels to show the same value?
